These classes implement the calls to the API. 

The user will typically use the classes package.

The queries will be cached and all subsequent calls will return 
the same information. If you want to disable the cache checking, 
then call VoteSmart.checkCache(false); or VoteSmart.checkCache(true);
to turn it back on.
